### 🧑‍💻 My Top Repositories
Check out some of my most notable repositories:


- [House Price Prediction - MLOps Pipeline](https://github.com/saimanas17/housing-price-prediction-mlops) - Architected and deployed a production-grade MLOps system for house price prediction, implementing automated end-to-end workflows from data ingestion to model serving. Built comprehensive pipeline using Airflow for orchestration, MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry, and BentoML for serving predictions via RESTful API. Established GitOps-driven CI/CD using Jenkins and ArgoCD, deployed on Kubernetes with automated weekly retraining, achieving seamless model versioning and zero-downtime deployments.
- [Argo Rollouts - Blue-Green Deployment Strategy](https://github.com/saimanas17/argocd-bluegreen) - Implemented automated Blue-Green deployment strategy using Argo Rollouts on Kubernetes to enable zero-downtime releases with instant rollback capability. Developed CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins that builds Docker images, updates Kubernetes manifests, and triggers GitOps-based deployments through ArgoCD. Created preview and production environments allowing thorough testing before traffic switching, with manual approval gates for controlled production releases. Demonstrated advanced Kubernetes deployment patterns for high-availability applications.
- [Trace Survey Deployment using GKE](https://github.com/saimanas17/trace-survey) - A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine with infrastructure provisioned using Terraform and application deployment managed through Helm charts. The containerized images are built using Jenkins CI/CD pipelines and pushed to Docker Hub for centralized image management. The entire Kubernetes cluster and RAG APIs are monitored using Prometheus and Grafana for metrics collection and visualization, with additional OpenTelemetry integration for comprehensive API observability and distributed tracing.
- [Spring Boot WebApp with AWS and Terraform Integration](https://github.com/saimanas17/springboot-aws-infra) - A full-stack Spring Boot application integrated with PostgreSQL and AWS services (SNS, Lambda, S3). It automates the creation of AWS infrastructure using Terraform and includes a Python Lambda function for user verification emails.
- [Jenkins HA Setup on AWS](https://github.com/saimanas17/jenkins-ha) - This project automates the deployment of a highly available Jenkins CI/CD environment on AWS using Infrastructure as Code tools (Terraform, Packer, Ansible). It provisions AWS resources, builds custom AMIs, and configures Jenkins controllers and agents for fault-tolerant continuous integration workflows

### 🧑‍💻 My Top Repositories
Check out some of my most notable repositories:

- [Trace Survey Deployment using GKE](https://github.com/saimanas17/trace-survey) - A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine with infrastructure provisioned using Terraform and application deployment managed through Helm charts. The containerized images are built using Jenkins CI/CD pipelines and pushed to Docker Hub for centralized image management. The entire Kubernetes cluster and RAG APIs are monitored using Prometheus and Grafana for metrics collection and visualization, with additional OpenTelemetry integration for comprehensive API observability and distributed tracing.
- [Spring Boot WebApp with AWS and Terraform Integration](https://github.com/saimanas17/springboot-aws-infra) - A full-stack Spring Boot application integrated with PostgreSQL and AWS services (SNS, Lambda, S3). It automates the creation of AWS infrastructure using Terraform and includes a Python Lambda function for user verification emails.
- [Jenkins HA Setup on AWS](https://github.com/saimanas17/jenkins-ha) - This project automates the deployment of a highly available Jenkins CI/CD environment on AWS using Infrastructure as Code tools (Terraform, Packer, Ansible). It provisions AWS resources, builds custom AMIs, and configures Jenkins controllers and agents for fault-tolerant continuous integration workflows
- [Fingertips](https://github.com/saimanas17/fingertips) - A full-stack application built during my time at Northeastern University.
